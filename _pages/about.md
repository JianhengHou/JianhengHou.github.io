Hi, I‚Äôm **Jianheng (Jaden) Hou**, a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/AI), where I lead initiatives in AI-powered smart automotive manufacturing. My work spans **Multimodal Models**, **AI Agents**, **Recommendation Systems**, **ML Infrastructure**, and **Applied Data Science**‚Äîdriving measurable impact across large-scale, high-stakes industrial workflows. In 2024, I was honored as one of the three most impactful contributors to Tesla Manufacturing.

Prior to Tesla, I worked at [Comcast](https://www.xfinity.com/overview) within the Enterprise Business Intelligence organization. As a Senior Data Scientist, I participated in a strategic rotation program, delivering end-to-end machine learning and analytics solutions for Xfinity‚Äôs product growth, customer experience, pricing strategies, and workforce optimization.

Before that, I was a Research Data Scientist at [Alpha Edison](https://www.alphaedison.com/), a data-driven venture capital firm. I developed [large-scale text mining](https://jianhenghou.github.io/Medical-Sieve/) pipelines and [anomaly detection and causal inference frameworks](https://jianhenghou.github.io/consumption-tracking-and-causal-analysis/) to identify latent industry pain points and emerging market signals‚Äîsupporting over $40M in investments across high-growth U.S. startups.

Earlier in my career, I served as a Research Assistant at the [Information Sciences Institute ‚Äì Center on Knowledge Graphs](https://www.isi.edu/centers-ckg/), where I contributed to the **DARPA-funded** [THOR Project](https://usc-isi-i2.github.io/thor/). This work focused on real-time global crisis management via dynamic knowledge graphs and situational awareness systems, and was successfully transitioned into [U.S. Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) applications.

I earned my M.S. in **Applied Data Science** from the [Viterbi School of Engineering](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/) at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/).

## Research Interests
My work is deeply cross-domain, integrating methods and insights across machine learning, manufacturing, enterprise systems, and decision science. I specialize in:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Multimodal Foundation Models</strong> for defect classification, inspection log understanding, and cross-modal fault pattern recognition</li>
  <li><strong>GraphRAG-style Agents</strong> for large-scale root cause analysis, supplier risk tracing, and engineering workflow acceleration</li>
  <li><strong>Causal Inference Frameworks</strong> for anomaly attribution, preventive action recommendation, and manufacturing resilience</li>
  <li><strong>AI-based Workforce Platforms</strong> for skill gap identification and AI-integrated job transition pathways</li>
</ul>

My current focus is scaling these frameworks into **enterprise-grade AI agents** that interface with real-time sensor data, service logs, supply contracts, and user behavior to support explainable, automated decisions across the industrial lifecycle.

## Life Beyond the Terminal

Outside of work, I thrive on **pushing physical boundaries** the same way I tackle technical ones:

- üèîÔ∏è **Alpine skiing** ‚Äî carving steep terrain with speed and precision  
- üåä **Scuba diving** ‚Äî free diving and catching lobster to share with friends  
- üèïÔ∏è **Camping** ‚Äî finding stillness and clarity deep in nature  
- üèãÔ∏è **Strength training** ‚Äî sustaining energy and balance with a daily endorphin boost  

These pursuits keep me grounded, focused, and ready for the next challenge‚Äîwhether in code or on a mountain.
