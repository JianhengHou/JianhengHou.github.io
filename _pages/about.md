Hi, I’m **Jianheng (Jaden) Hou**, a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/AI), where I lead initiatives in AI-powered smart automotive manufacturing. My work spans **Multimodal Models**, **AI Agents**, **Recommendation Systems**, **ML Infrastructure**, and **Applied Data Science**—driving measurable impact across large-scale, high-stakes industrial workflows. In 2024, I was honored as one of the three most impactful contributors to Tesla Manufacturing.

Prior to Tesla, I worked at [Comcast](https://www.xfinity.com/overview) within the Enterprise Business Intelligence organization. As a Senior Data Scientist, I participated in a strategic rotation program, delivering end-to-end machine learning and analytics solutions for Xfinity’s product growth, customer experience, pricing strategies, and workforce optimization.

Before that, I was a Research Data Scientist at [Alpha Edison](https://www.alphaedison.com/), a data-driven venture capital firm. I developed [large-scale text mining](https://jianhenghou.github.io/Medical-Sieve/) pipelines and [anomaly detection and causal inference frameworks](https://jianhenghou.github.io/consumption-tracking-and-causal-analysis/) to identify latent industry pain points and emerging market signals—supporting over $40M in investments across high-growth U.S. startups.

Earlier in my career, I served as a Research Assistant at the [Information Sciences Institute – Center on Knowledge Graphs](https://www.isi.edu/centers-ckg/), where I contributed to the **DARPA-funded** [THOR Project](https://usc-isi-i2.github.io/thor/). This work focused on real-time global crisis management via dynamic knowledge graphs and situational awareness systems, and was successfully transitioned into [U.S. Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) applications.

I earned my M.S. in **Applied Data Science** from the [Viterbi School of Engineering](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/) at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/).

## Research Interests

My interdisciplinary experience shapes a unique research perspective that blends **product-driven data science intuition**, **industrial-scale ML engineering**, and **cutting-edge academic innovation**. I focus on translating advanced AI concepts into real-world, high-impact solutions in complex enterprise settings. Specifically, my interests lie in:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Multimodal Foundation Models</strong> — aligning proprietary domain data (text, image, sensor) to build scalable, personalized recommendation systems and defect recognition pipelines</li>
  <li><strong>AI Agents</strong> — orchestrating enterprise-level workflows through tool-integrated GraphRAG systems and retrieval-augmented action agents</li>
  <li><strong>Applied Data Science</strong> — conducting user behavior analysis, building decision dashboards, and running causal inference experiments to guide product strategies</li>
  <li><strong>Machine Learning Systems</strong> — designing and deploying full-stack ML pipelines (online/offline), including infrastructure, monitoring, and model lifecycle management</li>
</ul>

## Life Beyond the Terminal

Outside of work, I thrive on **pushing physical boundaries** the same way I tackle technical ones:

- 🏔️ **Alpine skiing** — carving steep terrain with speed and precision  
- 🌊 **Scuba diving** — free diving and catching lobster to share with friends  
- 🏕️ **Camping** — finding stillness and clarity deep in nature  
- 🏋️ **Strength training** — sustaining energy and balance with a daily endorphin boost  

These pursuits keep me grounded, focused, and ready for the next challenge—whether in code or on a mountain.
