Hi, I‚Äôm **Jianheng (Jaden) Hou**, a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/AI) where I lead the AI-powered Smart Auto Manufacturing. My work sits at the intersection of **multimodal large language models**, **AI Agent(GraphRAG+Tools)**, **Recommendation and Search**, **ML Infra**, and **Applied Data Science** driving large-scale impact in high-stakes industrial settings. I was honored as one of three greatest impact perople at Tesla Manufacturing in 2024.

Before Tesla, I worked at [Comcast](https://www.xfinity.com/overview), Enterprise Business Intelligence and Data Science: Work in a strategic rotation program that delivers solutions for enterprise-level (Xfinity) product, growth, CX, finance, and workforce with core data science and ML

prior, I worked at [Alpha Edison](https://www.alphaedison.com/), a data-driven venture capital firm, where I built [large-scale text mining](https://jianhenghou.github.io/Medical-Sieve/) and [anomaly detection and causal inference systems](https://jianhenghou.github.io/consumption-tracking-and-causal-analysis/) to detect latent industrial pain points or early market signals to drive $40M+ invenstment on US Startups. 

I also served as a research assistant at the [Information Sciences Institute](https://www.isi.edu/) ([University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/)), contributing to the **DARPA-funded** [THOR Project](https://usc-isi-i2.github.io/thor/) on real-time global crisis management through [situation awareness](https://researchoutreach.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mayank-Kejriwal.pdf) based on knowledge graphs.

I earned my M.S. in **Applied Data Science** from [Viterbi School of Engineering](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/) at [USC](https://www.usc.edu/).

## Research Interests
My work is deeply cross-domain, integrating methods and insights across machine learning, manufacturing, enterprise systems, and decision science. I specialize in:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Multimodal Foundation Models</strong> for defect classification, inspection log understanding, and cross-modal fault pattern recognition</li>
  <li><strong>GraphRAG-style Agents</strong> for large-scale root cause analysis, supplier risk tracing, and engineering workflow acceleration</li>
  <li><strong>Causal Inference Frameworks</strong> for anomaly attribution, preventive action recommendation, and manufacturing resilience</li>
  <li><strong>AI-based Workforce Platforms</strong> for skill gap identification and AI-integrated job transition pathways</li>
</ul>

My current focus is scaling these frameworks into **enterprise-grade AI agents** that interface with real-time sensor data, service logs, supply contracts, and user behavior to support explainable, automated decisions across the industrial lifecycle.

## Life Beyond the Terminal

Outside of work, I thrive on **pushing physical boundaries** the same way I tackle technical ones:

- üèîÔ∏è **Alpine skiing** ‚Äî carving steep terrain with speed and precision  
- üåä **Scuba diving** ‚Äî free diving and catching lobster to share with friends  
- üèïÔ∏è **Camping** ‚Äî finding stillness and clarity deep in nature  
- üèãÔ∏è **Strength training** ‚Äî sustaining energy and balance with a daily endorphin boost  

These pursuits keep me grounded, focused, and ready for the next challenge‚Äîwhether in code or on a mountain.
