Hi, I’m **Jianheng (Jaden) Hou**, a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) where I lead the development of intelligent, AI-powered quality and supply chain systems at global production scale. My work sits at the intersection of **multimodal large language models**, **knowledge graph agents**, and **causal inference**, driving large-scale impact in high-stakes industrial settings.

Before Tesla, I worked at [Alpha Edison](https://www.alphaedison.com/), a data-driven venture capital firm, where I built text mining and anomaly detection systems for early signal detection in healthcare and consumer sectors. I also served as a research assistant at the [Information Sciences Institute](https://www.isi.edu/) ([University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/)), contributing to the **DARPA-funded** [THOR Project](https://researchoutreach.org/articles/crisis-management-artificial-intelligence-save-lives/) on real-time crisis knowledge graphs.

I earned my M.S. in **Applied Data Science** from [USC Viterbi School of Engineering](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/) and hold a B.S. in **Information Systems Management** from [Dalian Maritime University](https://en.dlmu.edu.cn/).

## Research Interests
My work is deeply cross-domain, integrating methods and insights across machine learning, manufacturing, enterprise systems, and decision science. I specialize in:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Multimodal Foundation Models</strong> for defect classification, inspection log understanding, and cross-modal fault pattern recognition</li>
  <li><strong>GraphRAG-style Agents</strong> for large-scale root cause analysis, supplier risk tracing, and engineering workflow acceleration</li>
  <li><strong>Causal Inference Frameworks</strong> for anomaly attribution, preventive action recommendation, and manufacturing resilience</li>
  <li><strong>AI-based Workforce Platforms</strong> for skill gap identification and AI-integrated job transition pathways</li>
</ul>

My current focus is scaling these frameworks into **enterprise-grade AI agents** that interface with real-time sensor data, service logs, supply contracts, and user behavior to support explainable, automated decisions across the industrial lifecycle.

## Life Beyond the Terminal

Outside of work, I thrive on **pushing physical boundaries** the same way I tackle technical ones:

- 🏔️ **Alpine skiing** — carving steep terrain with speed and precision  
- 🌊 **Scuba diving** — free diving and catching lobster to share with friends  
- 🏕️ **Camping** — finding stillness and clarity deep in nature  
- 🏋️ **Strength training** — sustaining energy and balance with a daily endorphin boost  

These pursuits keep me grounded, focused, and ready for the next challenge—whether in code or on a mountain.
